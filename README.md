# Titanic Survival Classifier 🚢

This is a machine learning project (in progress) using Scikit-learn to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.

## 🔧 Project Goals
- Load and explore the dataset using Pandas
- Clean and preprocess data
- Apply classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance

## 📦 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚧 Status
🛠️ Currently in development. Notebook and full results will be added shortly.

## 📁 Dataset
